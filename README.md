# GoogleSheet-API-and-Email
This is just an example of reading Google Sheets, reading the sheet as a dataframe and then parsing information from it.  The example
contains code for automatically sending out a scheduled email during a certain time of the day containing information from the google sheet.

Note: the code uses a loop on the dataframe.  Have since learned to use queries on the dataframe for faster performance
Note 2:  This is also using iteritems() which has been deprecated with items()
